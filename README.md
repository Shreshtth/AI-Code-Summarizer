# REPORT MAKING PROCESS
I spent my long weekend just researching about this topic that struck my mind. How does AI undersatnd the complex strutures and code context of programming languages? How to build better Code Summarizers which enhance code
comprehension without requiring additional input from the user? And i started reviewing the literature : all the conference papers, research papers, web articles and some github repos which I'll be linking here.
Github Repo used : https://github.com/agemagician/CodeTrans/tree/main.
Then I jotted down some important points to make a report, which were:
### Approaches for Autonomous Code Summarization

### Choice of LLMs

### Implementation Strategy

### Handling Code Structure and Context

### Challenges and Solutions

You are more than welcome to add or contribute anything to this repo be it a discussion/suggestion/any update.
Thank you for reading! I hope this report helps someone and saves their time and effort. If you've read this far, please don't forget to **STAR**, this repository.
