#REPORT MAKING PROCESS
I spent my long weekend just researching about this topic that struck my mind. How does AI undersatnd the complex strutures and code context of programming languages? How to build better Code Summarizers which enhance code
comprehension without requiring additional input from the user? And i started reviewing the literature : all the conference papers, research papers, web articles and some github repos which I'll be linking here.
Github Repo used : https://github.com/agemagician/CodeTrans/tree/main.
